# Python, R, & JavaScript Demo

This a small demo project that shows how values loaded into Python can be sent to the R environment, where some data analysis is done, and then values are returned to the Python environment. 

This example uses the Box and Jenkins airline data loaded into Python, R in order to generate a forecast about future data, and JavaScript to plot a chart show both the historical data and future data 

## Hat Tip
This project was build using the [Django Web Framework](https://www.djangoproject.com/), and built using the [Django Project Builder](https://github.com/prototypemagic/django-projectbuilder). A basic understanding on my part of doing time series analysis in R was made possible by the book [Introductory Time Series with R](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0387886974/). 

## Installing
To get this running on your own local machine, you will need Python and R installed. This has been tested on Mac OS X (Lion), with Python 2.7.1 and R version 2.15.2. First, clone the source: `git clone git@github.com:smoochy/tsj.git`.

The list of Python packages you need are listed in the requirements.txt file in the root folder of this project. You can install these by using the [pip package manager](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip). Once you have pip installed, run the following command inside of your project: `pip install -r requirements.txt`. This should install all of the listed packages into your Python environment, including rpy2, the Python bindings for the R environment.
